A guide to writing laboratory reports.

## Report Writing

Guidelines for the preparation of reports in the Stage 3 and Stage 4
Advanced Laboratories can be found here:
[ReportGuidelines.pdf](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/Report_and_Plagiarism/ReportGuidelines.pdf)

## Plagiarism

Students are reminded that they are expected to develop and
demonstrate indepentdent critical-thinking skills, and where they
include material in reports that is not their own original work then it
must be appropriately acknowledged and referenced. Academic integrity
is of the utmost importance and breaches are considered unacceptable.

#### Citing Information and Avoiding Plagiarism

Information on "Citing Information and Avoiding Plagiarism" is
provided by the UCD Library

#### Advanced Laboratories Plagiarism Document

At the start of Stage 3 all students in the Advanced Laboratories are required to read and sign the UCD
School of Physics Advanced Laboratories [Plagiarism
Document](https://physics.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2020/UCD_Physics_Labs_Plagiarism_statement.pdf)

#### Additional Information

Students are encouraged to read the [UCD Student Conduct web
page](https://www.ucd.ie/secca/studentconduct/) and especially the
section on "Avoiding Plagiarism".

In particular, students should be aware of the
