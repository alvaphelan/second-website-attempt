Introduction and Reference Documentaion for Computerised Data Acquisition in Python
<!--more-->

## Introdution
In the APL many experiments have computer-based data acquisition systems and
some also require the experiment to be controlled by a computer. The main work
horse is the National Instruments multi-function USB-6008 module, but a few
other systems are also in use. This page is to provide a basic introduction to
data acquisition techniques and to provide information on how to communicate with
the data acquisition hardware through Python.
