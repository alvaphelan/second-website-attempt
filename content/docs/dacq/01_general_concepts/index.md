## Analogue and Digital

{{< figure src="Analogue-vs-Digital.png" title="Figure: Analogue -vs- Digital" lightbox="true" width="600" >}}


Computers are digital systems and and at he most basic level store
information as sequences of bits (electronic states representing a 0 or 1,
for more information on voltages and logic levels see
[here](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/digital/chpt-3/logic-signal-voltage-levels/)).
Since there are only a finite number of ways of arranging a number of bits,
digital numbers are thus restricted to finite range of values.
Similarly, computer memory is finite and so is the number of digital
values which can be stored. Thus, **a signal stored on a computer is
discrete in both value (amplitide) and time**, as illustrated in the
two figures below:

{{< figure src="sine_dig.png" title="Figure: Digitised version of above sine function" lightbox="true" width="400" >}}



In the real world, analogue signals are continuous in both time and
amplitude, and interfacing with a computer involves conversion between
the digital and analogue domains. This ultimately involves either or
both of:

  * sending a digital number from the computer to a device
which converts it into an analogue signal

or

* taking an analogue signal and converting it into a digital signal which is sent to the computer.



The common nomenclature is:

| Term | Acronym | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| Digitial-to-Analogue Converter | DAC | Takes a digital signal (from computer) and convert to an analogue output signal|
| Analogue-Digital Converter | ADC | Converts an analogue signal to digital for recording by the computer  |

In addition, sometimes digital signals are sent directy to control
devices which have on/off states or to provide 'clock' signals for example to
move stepper motors.

## Bits, Bytes and Binary Numbers

Internally computers manipulate bits, which are voltages that
represent either a '1' or a '0'. Individual bits are grouped together
to store information (a collection of 8 bits is called a 'byte'). For
examples, ADCs may be 8 bit, 12 bit, 16 bit etc. The bits when
combined form a binary number since each location has only two
possible values.

For example, consider a byte consisting of 8 bits as shown below. Each
bit has a weight based on its position; the lowest weight ("least
significant bit") is on the right and the weights double with each
place to the left since each position can have two possibilities (a 1
or 0). The number of possible values is given by 2<sup>8</sup>=256 (0 to 255)

## Digitisation and Amplitude Resolution

Since computers only store digital values digitised
values are discrete. The number of bits combined with the range of the
ADC or DAC determines the resolution. For example, an 8-bit ADC with a
range of 5V has a resolution of ~0.0195V (5V/256) while a 12-bit ADC
with a range of 5V has a resolution of 0.0012V (5V/4096).
The affect of the number of
bits on the amplitude resolution can be seen in the figures below:

It is very important to match the ADC to the signal you are measuring, or to
amplify the signal to an appropriate level.

## Digitisation and Sampling
As mentioned above, due to the discrete nature of computers, signals which change are only captured
at discrete instances. The process of digisiting a signal as discrete intervals is known as **sampling**.
Sampling can introduce artefacts into digitised signals and it is critical to understand the basics of
sampling theory.

How many samples are needed to adequately describe a signal? The animation below illustrates what happens
when a signal is sampled at different rates (note in the caption 'f' is the frequency of the signal and 'fs' is the
sampling frequency):

{{< video src="sampling.mp4" controls="yes" >}}

As can be seen signals of the wrong frequencies appear (*aliasing*) when the sample rate drops to less than twice
the frequency of the signal.

### The Nyquist Sampling Criterion
The [Nyquist Sampling Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquistâ€“Shannon_sampling_theorem) states that to
completely record all of the information in a signal it must be sampled at at least twice the highest frequency
present, otherwise aliasing (the artifical transfer of power to lower frequencies occurs). For a perfect
sine wave this may also be states as a minimum of two points per cycle.

{{% callout note %}} It is critical to sample at a rate greater than
the Nyquist critical frequency (twice the highest frequency present)
to avoid aliasing.  {{% /callout %}}

A remarkable fact about the Nyquist sampling theorem is than once you
have met the sampling criterion, all of the information about the
original signal is captured in the samples and the the original signal
can be completely reconstructed from the them. This has many
applications in science, engineering, telecommunications etc. and, for
example, [why CD players use 44,100 Hz
sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz)

Aliasing is one of the reasons wheels can appear to rotate backward, see e.g.
