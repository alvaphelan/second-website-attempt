## Introduction

The [National Instruments USB-6008](https://www.ni.com/en-ie/support/model.usb-6008.html) is a
multi-function USB Data Acquisition device. There is also a
higher-performance version, the [USB-6009](https://www.ni.com/en-ie/support/model.usb-6009.html),
of which there are a couple in the APL, but they are identical to program.

The USB-6008/6009 each have:

| Feature | Number |
|---------|--------|
| ADC     | 8 channels (single-ended), 4 channels (differential)|
| DAC     | 2 channels|
| Digital I/O | 12 lines |
| Digital Counter | 1 line |


When an ADC channel is operated in **single-ended mode**, a single line is
used to measure the voltage w.r.t. ground.

When an ADC channel is operated in **differential mode**, two lines are
used to measure the voltage difference between them (neither need be at ground) -
hence only half of the number of channels are avaiable. The resolution
and ranges are better in differential than in single-ended mode and, **in general,
you should use differential mode**, unless more than 4 channels are needed. 


The table below describes the Analogue Input (AI) differences of the two modules:

| Feature | NI USB-6008 | NI USB-6009 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| AI | 12 bits differential, 11 bits single-ended | 14 bits differential, 13 bits single-ended | 
| Max AI sample rate (single channel) | 10 kS/s | 48 kS/s |
| Max AI sample rate (multiple channels, aggregate)| 10 kS/s | 48 kS/s |

There are also difference in the Digital I/O, but this is not a concern in the APL.

## USB-6008 Connections

The connections to the USB-6008 are made via screw terminals with a map of the connections shown in the figure below. The analogue connections are on one side while the digital are on the other. Several ground terminals are available. In the diagram

| Name | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| AI   | Analogue Input, i.e. ADC|
| AO   | Analoge Output, i.e. DAC|
| PF   | Digital Counter |
| P0/P1| Digital I/O Line|
| GND  | Ground |



{{< figure src="NI_USB6008_connections.png" title="Figure: NI USB-6008/6009 Connections" lightbox="true" width="500" >}}

Note that the figure shows both single-ended and differential
connections for the ADCs. So, for example, connections 2 and 3 can be
either AI 0 and AI 4 (in single-ended mode) or work together as a
single differential channel (AI 0+ and AI 0-).

## Programming the USB-6008
To communicate with the NI USB-6008 module we use a Python library
called [PyDAQmx_Helper](https://github.com/JohnQuinn1/PyDAQmx_Helper),
which was developed in the UCD School of Physics.



This library needs other libraries installed ([NIDAQmx](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z000000P8baSAC&l=en-IE) from National Instruments
and [PyDAQmx](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDAQmx/) which calls the NIDAQmx C-based interface.

{{% callout note %}}
All communication with the NI USB-6008 will utilise the the
PyDAQmx_Helper library and you will never need to interact directly
with the NIDAQmx or PyDAQmx libraries!
{{% /callout %}}


NIDAQmx, PyDAQmx and PyDAQmx_Helper are installed on all the APL computers that interface with experiments. If you have a problem
please contact a member of staff or a demonstrator.

{{% callout warning %}}
Do not install the NIDAQmx/PyDAQmx software on your own computer - use the computers provided for interfacing!

### Programming the ADC

#### Setting up
To communicate with the ADC Channels on the USB-6008 you must use the PyDAQmx_Helper ADC class.
There are two ways to read out the voltages, depending on whether you just want to read a single
voltage at a time from one channel, or want to sample voltages from one or more channels. The
first three steps are the same in either case:

  * import the ADC class
    ```python
       from pydaqmx_helper.adc import ADC
    ```
  * make an instance of the ADC class
    ```python
       myADC = ADC()
    ```
  * add channels, and optionally specify mode and range, e.g. to add just channel 0: 
    ```python
      myADC.addChannels([0])
    ```
    For options to ```ADC addChannels()``` see below.

<br/>

#### Adding Channels & Options

The ADC method:
```python
ADC.addChannels()
```
takes four arguments, three of which are optional
and default to the values shown:
```python
ADC.addChannels(newChannels, 
                ADC_mode="DAQmx_Val_Diff",
		minRange=-10.0,
		maxRange=10.0 )
```

 * ```newChannels``` is a list of channel ids to be added
 * ```ADC_mode``` is either ```"DAQmx_Val_Diff"``` for differential mode (default) or ```"DAQmx_Val_RSE"``` for single-ended mode
 * ```minRange``` and ```maxRange``` should be specified to most closely match the range of the signal you are measuring.

{{% callout warning %}}
If you are measuring a small voltage can lose resolution by not specifying the range since the defaults are ±10 V - make
sure to specify the correct range!
{{% /callout %}}

Note: there is also an ADC method
```python
ADC.getActiveChannels()
```
which returns a list of the channels that have been added.


<br/>

#### To read out a single voltage from a single channel

To reaout the voltage once when only a single channel is connected use the
ADC method:
```python
ADC.readVoltage()
```
which returns the voltage as a floating-point number.

Here is a complete code snippet to read out and print the voltage on channel 0:
```python
from pydaqmx_helper.adc import ADC

myADC = ADC()
myADC.addChannels([0])
val = myADC.readVoltage()
print(val)
```


#### To read out multiple channels and/or samples
If you want to read out more than one channel, or have the USB-6008
sample voltages at some sample rate (i.e. automatically read the
voltages at a specified rate) then you must use

```python
samples = sampleVoltages(nPointsPerChannel, sampleRate)
```
where the total number of samples per channel and the sample rate can be specificed
(both default to 1 if not given). Recall that the USB-6008 has a maximum sample rate
of 10 kS/s for all channels combined.

```ADC.sampleVoltages()``` returns a dictionary where the keys are the channel ids and
the values are the samples (as tuples):

{{< figure src="samplevoltages.png" title="Figure: dictionary returned by sampleVoltages" lightbox="true" width="600" >}}

Recall that the values are accessed using ```dict[key]``` and that tuples are immutable sequences.

Example: To to record 100 samples per channel at 200 Hz for channels 0 and 2, in differential mode (default), range = ±5V

```python
from pydaqmx_helper.adc import ADC

myADC = ADC()
myADC.addChannels([0,2], minRange=-5, maxRange=5)

data = myADC.sampleVoltages(100,200)

samples0 = data[0]  # tuple of samples associated with channel with id 0
samples2 = data[2]  # tuple of samples associated with channel with id 2
```

<br/>

### Programming the DAC

The USB-6008 has two independent DAC channels. They are programmed
from Python as follows:
 * Import the `DAC` class from `pydaqmx_helper.dac`:
   ```python
   from pydaqmx_helper.dac import DAC
   ```
 * Make an instance of the DAC class, specifying which channel (`0` or `1`) to use,
   e.g. to use channel `0`:
   ```python
   myDAC = DAC(0)
   ```
 * Write the voltage to it, e.g. to produce an output voltage of 2.62 V:
    ``` python
   myDAC.writeVoltage(2.62)
   ```

{{% callout note %}}
The DAC class works differently to the ADC class: with the ADC class you make
one instance of the class and add the channels, with the DAC class you specify
the channel when an instance is created. If you want to use both DAC channels you
need to make two instances of the class!

### Programming the Digital I/O Ports
The USB 6008 has an 8-bit port I/O (P0) and a 4-bit I/O port (P1) that can
be used individually or together as a single 12-bit port.

Usage:
  * Import the Digital_IO class
    ```python
    from pydaqmx_helper.digital_io import Digital_IO
    ```
  * Make an instance of the class. The `Digital_IO` class
    takes two (optional) arguments specifying the port and direction:
      * Options for `port` are: '`0`' for P0, '`1`' for P1 or '`0:1`' for both combined (default)
      * Options for direction are '`input`' or '`output`' (default).
    e.g.
    ```python
    myDigital_IO = Digital_IO()   # use defaults
    ```
    or
    ```
    python
    myDigital_IO = Digital_IO('0' 'input')  # P0 set up for output
    ```
  * If the port is set as an input then you can read from it using `read()`:
    ```python
    val = myDigital_IO.read() 
    ```

  * If the port is set as an output then you can write a value to it using `write(val)`,
    which returns a string representaiton of the binary numbers written out:
    ```python
    ans = myDigital_IO.write(255)  # write out binary 11111111: returns `0b11111111`
    ```
    Note it is the low bits of `val` that get written to the port.

<br/>

### Programming the Digital Counter

The 32-bit counter (pin PFI0) counts on the falling edge of a digital pulse.

Usage:
 * Import the counter class:
   ```python
   from pydaqmx_helper.counter import Counter
   ```
   
 * Make an instance of the counter class:
   ```python
   myCounter = Counter()
   ```

 * When ready, start counting:
   ```python
   myCounter.start()
   ```

 * Read out the number of counts at any time with:
   ```python
   val = myCounter.getCount()
   ```

* Read, stop and reset with:
   ```python
   val = myCounter.stop()
   ```
   Note: start() re-starts counting from 0.

The Python [time.sleep()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep) function is useful to use with the counter.
