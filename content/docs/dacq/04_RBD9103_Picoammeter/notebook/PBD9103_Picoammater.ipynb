    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [RBD 9103 Autoranging Picoammeter](http://www.rbdinstruments.com/products/picoammeter.html) is a USB device capable of measuring currents in the low pA to low mA range. The device has a variety of filter settings that can be used if the data are noisy, and it can produce currents on demand, or deliver them at some selectable rate. While the range can be user-selected, it is recommended to use it in auto-ranging mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication with the device can be through the software provided, a serial terminal communication program, or through Python using the pyserial library."

    "Once the device driver has been installed the picoammeter can be accessed as a serial device on the PC by reading/writing text commands, or by using the *Actual* software that comes with it. The *Actuel* software includes a console that can be used to write and read commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively I used the *Termite* (http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm) serial communication software for testing. To use in termite or Python we must first find out what COM port it is on. Do this by looking for *FT232R USB UART* in Windows (7) *Devices and Printers*, double click on it and select *Hardware* and we see the COM port (COM3 when I tested this one). If you are having problems I recommend this as a fallback to see what the device is doing."

You should try different filter values to see which work best for reducing noise in your data."
