## Python in advanced Laboratories

Python is an extremely useful tool when used properly. The aim of this web page is to provide an easy to naviagte resource for helping studemts that are not confident in coding. These 'how-to's' will provide a simplified explanation on how to do the things you need for the labs, while the suplementary material will provide a slightly more advanced and in-depth view on how/why things work, for those who have mastered the basics. It is a hard skill to attain, so never be afraid to ask questions, and don't worry about getting things wrong the first time!
