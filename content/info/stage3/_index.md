## Introductory Talk

The Stage 3 Advanced Laboratory Introductory Talk will be given by
Assoc. Prof. Emma Sokell at 2pm on Tuesday, September 14th in
room Science South S3.56. [[Slides]](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/Stage3_Lab_Intro2122.pdf)

## Advanced Laboratory Dates

For trimester 1 the laboratories begin on Tuesday, September 14 and
run until Thursday, December 2.

## Report deadlines
Each experiment including write up should take approximately three weeks.
You will not be given a new experiment until the report from the previous one has been submitted.


## Introductory Sessions

The first three weeks of the laboratory will entail a series of
lectures/tutorials, "hands-on" sessions (on Zoom) and exercises which
will be graded. The introductory exercises will count as one
laboratory experiment (2.5 credits) for assessment reasons.
Experimental work in
the laboratory will commence in week four.  Zoom links will be
circulated by email.

Please ensure you have Anaconda Python (>3.6) installed on your computer
for the hands-on zoom sessions. [Download Anaconda]({{< ref "/docs/python/020_Get_Python/" >}})

  * Note: the sessions have been traditionally split into two due to timetable clashes and a limited number of computers in the lab. However, as we are on zoom with no computer limit and we undertsand there is no timetable clash this year, **everyone is welcome (and encouraged) to join from 2pm - 6pm!**

### Exercises and Weighting

The five introductory exercise sets, **which must be submitted as five individual PDFs (together in a single submission) through Brightspace as your first assignment**, can be found below. The breakdown of marks will be:

|Exercise | Weighting| Documents |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Python Basics | 20%      | [Stage3_Python_Basics_Exercises_2021.pdf](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/Stage3_Python_Basics_Exercises_2021.pdf), [simdacq.py](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/simdacq.py)|
| Data Analysis I | 20% | [Jupyter Notebook template I](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/AdvLabDataWeek1-Sept2021.ipynb), [counts.dat](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/counts.dat) |
| Data Analysis II | 20% |  [Jupyter Notebook template II](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/AdvLabDataWeek2-Sept2021.ipynb), [thermocouple.dat](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/thermocouple.dat) |
| Python Numpy & Scipy | 20%      | [Problems.pdf](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/Scipy/NumPy_SciPy_Exercises.pdf), [csv file](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/Scipy/WindGeneration_24.Jul.2021.00.00_22.Aug.2021.23.59.csv)
| Statistics and Error Analysis | 20%| [Error_Analysis_Exercises_2021.pdf](https://physicslabs.ucd.ie/~apl/labs_master/docs/2021/S3Intro/Error_Analysis_Exercises_2021.pdf) |

The introductory exercises are in place of one experiment for 2021-2022 and worth 2.5 credits, which equates to approximately 50 hours of work, so each exercise set should take approximately 10 hours.
